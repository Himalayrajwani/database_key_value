A File based key-Value Data Store that support CRD (Create , Read, Delete) .

How it Works ?
We have Created a file-based data store which can be used as a local storage for one single process on one laptop .

'main2.py' includes all the functionalities such as Create , Delete , Read , Modify .

In order to make use of those of functionalities , we have created a another file 'acess.py' in which we have imported 'main2.py' as a library.

So please go through the 'acess.py' for working of data-store as it includes all the commands .

Also , 'p1.png  ,p2.png' is attached to demonstrate its working in cmd.
